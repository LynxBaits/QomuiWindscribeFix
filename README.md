You will need root access to your filesystem to install this fix. The files we will be swapping are protected.

**Step 1**
Open terminal and type `locate update.py`
This location will vary based on your installed version of Python.

**Step 2**
Write down where your update.py is. It should look something like this `/usr/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/qomui/update.py`

**Step 3**
Download update.py from above.

**Step 4**
Replace the update.py file in the directory you wrote down, with the one you downloaded.

**You're done.**
Note: You may still need to reboot the computer for the file to do into affect.
